Among those issues are problems that many modern women face such as harassment, domestic violence, and gender discrimination etc. 
When some women face those issues, they don't want to speak up or seek help. Some of them blame themselves for what happen to them.
In order to help women who face harassment, domestic violence, and gender discrimination etc. seek help and overcome issues, we have developed "Speak Out"
